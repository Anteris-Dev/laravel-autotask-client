# Contributing
Hey there! We would love to implement your feedback and contributions into this package. Before taking the time to write up a full PR, please make sure you understand our guidelines so that no ones loses any of their valuable time.

First off, before making a change, please discuss the change you wish to make via a Github issue in this repository. You can do that [here](https://github.com/Anteris-Dev/autotask-client/issues).

Second, we are going to let you in on some of the secret sauce that makes this package work. There is actually a really neat generator we built over at [autotask-client-generator](https://github.com/Anteris-Dev/autotask-client-generator). This saves us time by building out templates for each service / entity class and working directly with the Autotask API to define them in code. Don't lose time by making tedious changes to the 160+ endpoint service files that exist. Let's forward your issue over there and let you make your PR where the magic happens.

# Pull Request Process
For either of these repositories, there are three simple rules to follow regarding pull requests.

1. Don't create a pull request unless it has an issue that has been approved for one of our milestones.
2. Update the README.md with details of any changes to the interface that developers will interact with (new methods, commands, etc.).
3. Increase the version numbers to the new version that this pull request will represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
